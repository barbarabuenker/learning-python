### General questions (try to look it up or ask about it in class!):

- ~~I don't get the use of while loops.~~ --> see [Python while loop](https://pynative.com/python-while-loop/)
- How can I solve the "LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time ..."-problem when running git add?
- I don't get the chapter on [Customize Sort Function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_sort.asp)
- It is better to choose e. g. "items" in a for loop insteas of "i", right?
- Use of bool()?
- Generally, had trouble with the whole Holy Python If, Elif, Else Exercises chapter.
- Functions: I don't get the difference between **args and **kwargs.
- Functions: Don't get the chapter on recursion.
