lst.sort()
print(lst)
```

## Exercise 11-b
**Question: The solution says lst.sort(reverse = False) - but this is the default argument, so why write it down?**

lst.sort()
print(lst)

popped_item = lst.pop()
print(popped_item)
print(lst)
```

## Exercise 12-b
**Question: Why does lst.pop(a) work with round brackets? We're working with indexing here, shouldn't we use square brackets: lst.pop[a]?**

lst = ["milk", "banana", "eggs", "bread", "broccoli", "lemons"]
item = lst.pop(lst.index("broccoli"))
print(lst, item)
```

```

## Exercise 17-c
```phyton
wrd = "Toscana"
ans_1 = wrd[3:6]
print(ans_1)
```

## Exercise 17-d
**Question/having trouble understanding this!**\
**Update/Answer: [x:y:z] means "from x to y-1 in steps of z"** 
```phyton
wrd = "Toscana"
ans_1 = wrd[0::2]
print(ans_1)
```

## Exercise 17-e
**Question/having trouble understanding this!**\
**Update/Answer: See exercise 17-d**
```phyton
wrd = "Toscana"
ans_1 = wrd[1:-1:2]
print(ans_1)
```

## Exercise 17-f
**Question/having trouble understanding this!**\
**Update/Answer: See exercise 17-d**\
**Note to self: This is actually not a good way to do it - it's not immediately clear what's happening here! What we should be doing: .reverse()! So for the future, resist the temptation and use the reverse-function so other people will understand as well!**
```phyton
lst = [0,1,2,3,4]
ans_1 = lst[::-1]
print(ans_1)
```

## Exercise 17-g
**Question/having trouble undertstanding this!**\
**Update/Answer: See exercise 17-d"**
```phyton
lst = [0,1,2,3,4]
ans_1 = lst[-2:]
print(ans_1)
```

## Exercise 17-h
```phyton
lst = [40,50,20,30,90]
ans_1 = lst[1:3] 
print(ans_1)
```
