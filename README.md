### learning-python
A repository created for documenting my process of learning **Python** :smile: 

* Includes exercises from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/), [Holy Python](https://holypython.com) as well as [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/users/barbarabuenker/) (files can be found in the respective folders) ...
* ... as well as class notes with useful notes and problems we solved together.
