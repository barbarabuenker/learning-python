### learning-python
A repository created for documenting my process of learning **Python** :snake: 

Includes ...
* **exercises** from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/), [Holy Python](https://holypython.com), [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/users/barbarabuenker/) as well as [PYnative](https://pynative.com) - partly with questions and notes inserted (files can be found in the respective folders),
* a file for **general questions** I have,
* a file to document my **history of latest Python highlights**,
* as well as **class notes** with useful notes and problems we solved together.
